# Hang in There  
A motivational poster experience.

### Abstract:
Sometimes, we feel sad. What better way to feel more joy than creating or discovering a new inspirational poster. This application allows its users to create random posters, but also customize them. The customized posters will also be stored automatically and parts of your custom poster could be displayed in the random poster selection. The posters can be both saved and deleted. 


### Installation Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Type `cd hang-in-there-pairedProject` to move into the root directory

### Preview of App:

The saved posters page allows users to keep their favorite posters. They can also save the posters they created using the make your own poster form. The poster on the right is a saved unique poster that used the form to input the picture, title, and quote. 

### Context:
This project marked the end of week 2, in module one. We worked on this application for approximately 16 hours, which spanned for five days.

### Learning Goals:
- Continue to practice creating DRY and readable JavaScript. Practice the single responsibility principle (SRP) in our functions to ensure functionality and simplicitiy. 
- Learned how to use the DOM to manipulate HTML and CSS, enabling application functionality. 
- Learn more HTML and CSS language markers, in order to recognize which parts of the code are connected to which parts of the application.
- Create event listeners to make a more interactive application.
- Practice communicating, as well as giving and receiving feedback from a teammate. Making sure everyones ideas feel heard, and any concerns are addressed before moving forward. 
- Practicing a consistent Git workflow to save work and stay on the same page. 

### Wins + Challenges:
#### Wins
- Great open communication, and strong collaboration between teammates. 
- Enabling the application to have functionality despite not knowing most concepts. 
- Able to support and collaborate with other teams and creating a safe environment to do so. 

#### Challenges
- The deleting posters functionality took the longest to collaborate on, and was achieved through help from others. Without others' insights and prior knowledge, we are unsure if we would have achieved functionality.
- We still need to practice taking more breaks, as well as tracking the time of unproductive struggle. There were only a few times that happened, but the times it did caused us to spend multiple hours on one aspect of the application functionality.
